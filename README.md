Workout Tracker is a lightweight fitness tracking app built with Next.js and ShadCN UI. It allows users to log workouts manually by entering exercises, sets, reps, and weights â€” along with metadata like date, duration, location, and notes. Users can also add custom exercises, and view their full workout history saved locally in the browser.
